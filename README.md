# Galactic Cargo Management System (GCMS)

This project is part of the **Data Structures and Algorithms** course at **IIT Delhi**.

In this assignment, I have implemented three **AVL Trees** to efficiently manage the **Galactic Cargo Management System (GCMS)**. One of these AVL trees is a **nested AVL tree**, allowing for optimized handling of cargo bins and objects.

The GCMS handles different types of cargo (distinguished by color) and assigns them to bins using various bin-packing algorithms such as Compact Fit and Largest Fit.
